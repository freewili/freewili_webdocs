Beyond the obvious cost of an electricity bill, leaving the lights on costs around contributes to a larger, collective carbon footprint. To inspire a shift from unconscious waste to conscious conservation, we designed Wattson that tackles this challenge and empowers individuals to minimize society\u2019s carbon footprint.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udca1 What it does\\r\\n\\r\\nWattson is aimed to reduce your electricity waste by encouraging users to minimize the time their light is on through gamified experiences. Wattson is a cute, virtual pet that you aim to keep alive and nurture. If you leave the lights on for too long, you risk losing your beloved Wattson. On the other hand, be eco-friendly and Wattson regains health and gives you points. Points are used in the shop to buy Wattson his favorite cosmetics, animations, and sounds. It all comes down to one simple mission: be eco-friendly and keep Wattson alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde0 How we built it\\r\\n\\r\\nWe developed the program through Python. The project is divided into three parts, the OpenCV model, backend environment and the user interface on the FREE-WILi.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe used a proprietary graphics innovation, built to scale from the ground up. Because of the lack of GUI for the python api of freeWili, and us only being able to push images to the screen, we utilized the pillow library to dynamically stitch images together to create a game ready gui, capable of running at just seconds per frame. With this robust solution, we can scale easy as the first ai powered lightbulb assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OpenCV model stores two image files (old_photo and new_photo). Every 15 seconds, old_photo is discarded, new_photo becomes old_photo, and a new photo is taken. The computer vision model calculates the difference in brightness between the old_photo and new_photo to detect if lights were switched on/off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe backend environment mainly exists within the Pet class, where variables such as health, points, the amount of time the lights were on, etc. are tracked. Additionally, functions that control the conditions for losses and gains of a pet\'s health depending on the usage of lights are implemented. These functions and variables are utilized to connect with the user interface of the FREE-WILi device.\\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde9 Challenges we ran into\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest challenge we encountered was with the FREE-WILi firmware. There was a huge learning curve with learning implementation with the Python API. \x3c!-- and there were functionalities that didn\u2019t work every time we wanted them to. --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfc6 Accomplishments that we\'re proud of\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are proud to say that we developed our own, custom graphics interface on FREE-WILi and a program that detects if the lights are switched on or off to interact with the self-designed pet. We believe this program will be a foundation for developing a greater program that tackles higher-stake environmental issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udf93 What we learned\\r\\n\\r\\nWe learned about how difficult it is to develop a program that interacts with an embedded developmental tool. Developing a program solely on a computer and a program that interacts with multiple devices was another challenge. Sometimes, some problems are impossible to solve and we just need to find a work-around.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What\'s next for Wattson\\r\\n\\r\\nOur next steps would be to broaden our usage in generative AI to effectively detect further scenarios where energy is being wasted. The generative AI will be used to add a personality on the pets to improve the interaction with the user by adding talking or sending texts to the user for reducing waste or turning off lights properly. Though we were not able to fully implement a system that tracks when the person leaves the room, we will further improve on the CV model to include such situations as well. Beside light, the project will expand to the detection for better sustainability, such as water, trash, food waste, and heat. Additionally, we will improve the user experience through adding interactions with other people by including leaderboards, clans, and battling (such as in pokemon).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde9 Built With  \\r\\n\\r\\n```freewili``` ```opencv``` ```python```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- ### Try it out\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\"github-img\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n![GitHub](./github.png) <a href=\\"https://github.com/Nailfighter/VisionCane\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span>GitHub Repo</span></a>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n *Source* - [https://devpost.com/software/visioncane/](https://devpost.com/software/visioncane/) --\x3e"},{"id":"will-i-study","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/will-i-study","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-06/will-i-study.mdx","title":"Will I Study?","description":"Keep yourself accountable with a study session tracker!

Our name was inspired by the historical use of stars for navigation. Our goal is to benefit both the customer and employee, by allowing the customer to be more thoughtful about their choices and speeding up their grocery trip while streamlining customer service on the employee side.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\uded2 What it does\\r\\n\\r\\nCelestaisle is a smart shopping tool that streamlines shopping experiences from planning beforehand to in-store navigation. The app allows users to enter their zip code, provide a budget, and input their shopping list, which could include separate ingredients or potential recipes. The app looks for nearby stores and pulls item lists from each. Behind the scenes, AI is used to optimize and improve the shopping list, suggesting additional items the user may want and allowing misspellings. Options from different price ranges are given so that the user can choose between the generic brand, name brand, and organic options. Then, mapping information for a path through the store is sent to the FREE-WILi Compasses. Customers\' pagers (attached to their shopping carts) display the map to navigate through the stores and buttons can be pressed to indicate an item has been found. In addition, customer pagers can emit an IR signal to request help from an employee, turning on the LEDs. Each customer pager has its own color ID associated. When employee pagers receive that IR request, the customer is added to the help queue and the LEDs on the FREE-WILi pager display the queue by color ID. Once a customer is helped, employees can mark the customer as \\"helped\\", which removes their color ID from the LED queue, and the customer LED lights turn off through a received IR signal.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udee0 How we built it\\r\\n\\r\\n**App & Backend**  \\r\\nWe used React Native and Expo for the app, with a python backend. The backend utilizes Flask and the Google Gemini API.\\r\\n\\r\\n**FREE-WILi Compasses**  \\r\\nWe programmed the FREE-WILi Compasses in Python using the provided interface documentation. We made use of the IR signals to communicate between FREE-WILi modules. We wirelessly uploaded custom images onto the screens and used the button and LED interface to allow customers to check off their path and page for help.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Challenges we ran into\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ran into big challenges with the FREE-WILi modules. We couldn\'t get CMake working at all, even with the help of the folks at FREE-WILi, so we ended up having to use the Python interface, which brought up some roadblocks with our initial implementation ideas, but we still managed to get the compasses working how we wanted. We were hoping to use RF to communicate long distance between the FREE-WILis, however, there ended up actually being an issue with the FREE-WILi API, so we were unable to use that feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfc6 Accomplishments that we\'re proud of\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are proud that we were able to get over the initial roadblock we faced with the CMake issues, and to have used an AI API in a project for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udcda What we learned\\r\\n\\r\\nWe learned how using an AI API works, and how to take advantage of the FREE-WILi Device. Some members worked with frontend backend integration for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd2e What\'s next for Celestaisle\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would seek to use the FREE-WILi as a standalone device by uploading wasm files to the device.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde9 Built With  \\r\\n\\r\\n```expo.io```\\r\\n```gemini```\\r\\n```python```\\r\\n```reactnative```\\r\\n```sql```\\r\\n```typescript```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Try it out\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\"github-img\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n![GitHub](./github.png) <a href=\\"https://github.com/n0vendy/celestaisle\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span>GitHub Repo</span></a>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n *Source* - [https://devpost.com/software/celestaisle/](https://devpost.com/software/celestaisle/)"},{"id":"visioncane","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/visioncane","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-03/index.mdx","title":"VisionCane - Empowering independence through intelligent navigation","description":"\u2728 VisionCane is a step towards empowering visually impaired individuals with affordable, intelligent assistive technology.","date":"2025-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FREE-WILi","permalink":"/blog/tags/FREE-WILi","description":"Make Embedded Systems Fun Again !"},{"inline":false,"label":"Mhacks","permalink":"/blog/tags/mhacks","description":"mhacks"},{"inline":false,"label":"Student Project","permalink":"/blog/tags/studentproject","description":"studentproject"},{"inline":false,"label":"Hackathon","permalink":"/blog/tags/hackathon","description":"hackathon"}],"readingTime":2.47,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Shreyansh Sahu","url":"https://devpost.com/alphagameryt024","imageURL":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/user_photos/003/790/683/datas/profile.jpg","key":"Shreyansh Sahu","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"visioncane","title":"VisionCane - Empowering independence through intelligent navigation","authors":["Shreyansh Sahu"],"tags":["FREE-WILi","mhacks","student project","hackathon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"celestaisle","permalink":"/blog/celestaisle"},"nextItem":{"title":"Wili pass","permalink":"/blog/wili-pass"}},"content":"> \u2728 VisionCane is a step towards empowering visually impaired individuals with affordable, intelligent assistive technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nimport MyCarousel from \'@site/src/components/Carousel\';\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* <MyCarousel /> */}\\r\\n\\r\\nexport const slides = [\\r\\n  { type: \'image\', src: \'/img/blog/visioncane.jpg\', alt: \'visioncane\', caption: \\"visioncane\\" },\\r\\n  { type: \'image\', src: \'/img/blog/stick.jpg\', alt: \'stick\', caption: \\"\\" },\\r\\n  { type: \'image\', src: \'/img/blog/stick-freewili.jpg\', alt: \'stick-freewili\', caption: \\"\\" },\\r\\n];\\r\\n\\r\\n<MyCarousel slides={slides} />\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udf1f Inspiration\\r\\n\\r\\nI was inspired by the daily challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in navigating unfamiliar environments and wanted to create an affordable, accessible solution that could enhance their independence and safety using modern technology.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udc40 What it does\\r\\n\\r\\nVisionCane uses YOLO object detection to identify obstacles and landmarks, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for precise distance measurement, and FREE-WILi\'s LIS3DH accelerometer to detect cane movement and orientation.

In a world where thefts and break-ins are a constant concern, I wanted to create a system that could actively monitor and protect my home and vehicle from unauthorized access. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e Starting with basic components like motion sensors and facial recognition, I gradually built upon this concept to integrate features such as voice recognition and night vision for 24/7 security.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What I Learned** Throughout the process, I learned how to integrate AI-powered systems with hardware like PIR motion sensors, cameras, and microphones. I explored facial recognition and voice detection technologies, gaining experience with Raspberry Pi and other sensors to improve security features. This project expanded my knowledge of system integration, real-time monitoring, and how to handle different types of inputs to create a cohesive, functional security system.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Building the Project** I began with the idea of a simple security system using motion detection and a basic camera for monitoring. As I progressed, I added PIR motion sensors to detect movement around the vehicle and property, along with facial recognition to identify individuals. The integration of voice recognition and night vision capabilities brought the system to a new level, enabling it to work effectively even in low-light environments.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Challenges Faced** The main challenges included configuring the facial recognition software and ensuring it could detect faces accurately from various angles and distances. Integrating all the components, including PIR sensors, camera systems, and voice recognition, required troubleshooting and optimizing the connections for smooth real-time performance. Another challenge was calibrating the motion detection system to avoid false alerts, which took time to fine-tune.\\r\\n\\r\\n**From Start to Finish** What I started with was a basic concept of monitoring using motion sensors, evolving it into a fully integrated vehicle and property monitoring system that can detect motion, identify individuals, and provide alerts in real-time. The final project, Safe X Guardian, is a smart, comprehensive security solution that actively monitors surroundings, providing enhanced protection for both vehicles and property.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Built With\\r\\n\\r\\n```c``` ```freewili``` ```python``` ```raspberry-pi``` ```whadda```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Try it out\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\"github-img\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n![GitHub](./github.png) <a href=\\"https://github.com/Akshith-AI/Spartahack-X\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span>GitHub Repo</span></a>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n*Source* - [https://devpost.com/software/safe-x-guardian](https://devpost.com/software/safe-x-guardian)"},{"id":"theremini","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/theremini","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-06/index.mdx","title":"thereMINI: Creating Music with Hand Gestures Using FREE-WILi for a Touch-Free Sound Experience","description":"The Wearable Theremin! thereMINI is a wearable theremin using FREE-WILi to turn hand movements into music, translating motion into notes and volume for a touch-free, expressive sound experience.","date":"2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FREE-WILi","permalink":"/blog/tags/FREE-WILi","description":"Make Embedded Systems Fun Again !"},{"inline":false,"label":"SpartaHack X","permalink":"/blog/tags/spartahack-x","description":"spartahack-x"},{"inline":false,"label":"Hackathon","permalink":"/blog/tags/hackathon","description":"hackathon"},{"inline":false,"label":"Student Project","permalink":"/blog/tags/studentproject","description":"studentproject"}],"readingTime":3.6,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Evan Fioritto","title":"Michigan State University Junior Majoring in Computer Science, Minoring in Information Technology","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanfioritto/","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQGnUgiBv-EyUQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1725555942934?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=EZGdis3uVdg-VTrpbg5lFxDJ3zfN2TJWS2KDleEK1Dk","key":"Evan Fioritto (fiorittoev)","page":null},{"name":"Richard Glosser","title":"Computer Science @ Michigan State University","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-glosser-76145426b","imageURL":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/user_photos/003/042/349/datas/profile.jpg","key":"Richard Glosser","page":null},{"name":"Tess Gonda","title":"CSE Student @ Michigan State University","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tess-gonda-abb1b5309","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQFEjwMKg6LocQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1715288605164?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=MYl5stpGSNIVDulr1GvNM464u2yySSsfh0QWm4AIatw","key":"Tess Gonda","page":null},{"name":"Ramya Ramkumar","title":"CS Student @ Michigan State University","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramyaramkumar","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQHSYB6UnKWDNw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1718283609856?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=P6G5ZGE6kc8C50y8oU5YDiAKRkPlgK-FV8eRhuu6wuA","key":"Ramya Ramkumar","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"theremini","title":"thereMINI: Creating Music with Hand Gestures Using FREE-WILi for a Touch-Free Sound Experience","authors":["Evan Fioritto (fiorittoev)","Richard Glosser","Tess Gonda","Ramya Ramkumar"],"tags":["FREE-WILi","SpartaHack X","hackathon","student project"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Project Story: Safe X Guardian","permalink":"/blog/safe-x-guardian"},"nextItem":{"title":"WiLi-Party LED Minigames","permalink":"/blog/wiLi-party"}},"content":"The Wearable Theremin! thereMINI is a wearable theremin using FREE-WILi to turn hand movements into music, translating motion into notes and volume for a touch-free, expressive sound experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nimport MyCarousel from \'@site/src/components/Carousel\';\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* <MyCarousel /> */}\\r\\n\\r\\nexport const slides = [\\r\\n  { type: \'video\', src: \'W0wFaAqFdok\' }, // YouTube video\\r\\n  { type: \'image\', src: \'/img/blog/logo.jpg\', alt: \'logo\', caption: \'Our Logo and Mascot, T-Mini!

Inspired by conducting, we mapped hand motion to notes and volume, making music creation more intuitive and inclusive. We continue to design this as a accessible device, but it is for everyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfb5 What It Does\\r\\nUsing the FREE-WILi we were able to extract the accelerometer data as serial data. Converting said data to MIDI data (a music data type) we were able to use music software, like Ableton to translate it into virtual instrument playing. Moving your hand down increases volume and putting it down increases it. Moving your hand left or right changes notes, specifically a scale of 8 notes. Combining all that we can emulate a full virtual keyboard with just the movement of your hand!\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How We Built It\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Hardware:** FREE-WILi device is a wearable microprocessor, outfitted with many sensors and capabilities, the one we focused on is the accelerometer. We used this mainly to translate xyz coordinates into angles, and then MIDI values for the notes and volume. This data is sent through USB serial data to be read by the software.\\r\\n* **Software:** We used C++, and C to embed functionality for the FREE-WILi and python to clean and extract the data from it. loopMIDI is a software that creates a virtual MIDI controller that reads from our script, and feeds it to DAWs.\\r\\n* **Implementation:** The horizontal rotation is used for the notes on a rotation of -90 -> 90 degrees, and the vertical rotation is used for lowering and increasing the pitch on -30 -> 30 degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udea7 Challenges We Ran Into\\r\\nWe addressed USB port access challenges between WSL and Windows, ensuring proper connectivity. Translating accelerometer data into MIDI required refining sensitivity and applying filtering to improve accuracy. By optimizing data formatting and transmission, we facilitated seamless MIDI transfer. Through continuous troubleshooting and iterative testing, we achieved smooth integration between hardware and software.\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfc6 Accomplishments We\'re Proud Of\\r\\nOur project focused on turning complex tasks into key milestones. A major achievement was enabling MIDI data transfer from FREE-WILi to a computer, converting user movements into precise musical instructions like pitch and velocity. Our greatest achievement was the design of the notes and pitch to hand movements, and what was the most ergonomic and accessible way we would implement it.\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udcda What We Learned\\r\\nWe learned how to process real-time sensor data into MIDI signals, ensuring seamless hardware-software integration. Designing for accessibility taught us the importance of intuitive and ergonomic control. Optimizing MIDI implementation required refining pitch, velocity, and minimizing latency. Through iterative problem-solving, we debugged formatting errors and fine-tuned movement sensitivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What\'s Next for thereMINI\\r\\nWe plan to enhance thereMINI with scale mode, chord mode, and octave control, mapped to buttons on the FREE-WILi for seamless switching. A GUI will provide visual feedback and customization options. Beyond development, thereMINI has potential as an accessible instrument, an innovative tool for musicians, and an educational device for learning music through motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr/>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Built With\\r\\n\\r\\n```ableton``` ```accelerometer``` ```c``` ```c++``` ```freewili``` ```loopmidi``` ```pyserial``` ```python``` ```rtmidi```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Try it out\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\"github-img\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n![GitHub](./github.png) <a href=\\"https://github.com/fiorittoev/theremini\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span>GitHub Repo</span></a>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n*Source* - [https://devpost.com/software/theremini](https://devpost.com/software/theremini)"},{"id":"wiLi-party","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wiLi-party","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-10/index.md","title":"WiLi-Party LED Minigames","description":"Inspiration","date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FREE-WILi","permalink":"/blog/tags/FREE-WILi","description":"Make Embedded Systems Fun Again !"},{"inline":false,"label":"Mhacks","permalink":"/blog/tags/mhacks","description":"mhacks"},{"inline":false,"label":"Hackathon","permalink":"/blog/tags/hackathon","description":"hackathon"},{"inline":false,"label":"Student Project","permalink":"/blog/tags/studentproject","description":"studentproject"}],"readingTime":2.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Andi Shaska","title":"CSE @ University of Michigan","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andi-shaska","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQHXrZrh8KFeEw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1703796143917?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=RqiGYItuNXyk1k7RFprjvBrMkEkYIgivHqAJpiA8XCg","key":"Andi Shaska","page":null},{"name":"Harshad Bhojan","title":"Computer Science @ University of Michigan CoE","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshad-bhojan","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEIRmbQhhAB5w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1608520744606?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=g5S5Fgc41al3WUtTO6aVXK_vjtp1L2QcMQTgVorbTzg","key":"Harshad Bhojan","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"wiLi-party","title":"WiLi-Party LED Minigames","authors":["Andi Shaska","Harshad Bhojan"],"date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["FREE-WILi","mhacks","hackathon","student project"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"thereMINI: Creating Music with Hand Gestures Using FREE-WILi for a Touch-Free Sound Experience","permalink":"/blog/theremini"},"nextItem":{"title":"WiLi Watch \u2013 Voice-Activated Wearable for Smart Home Control","permalink":"/blog/wiLi-watch"}},"content":"import YouTubeEmbed from \'@site/src/components/YouTubeEmbed\';\\n\\n<YouTubeEmbed videoId=\\"7VzAm0KVVoo\\" />\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\nWe love competitive games like Mario Party and the cuteness of small devices like Tamagotchi. We wanted a project that combines the two, which is why the free wili seemed like a great system to use.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What it does\\n\\nGives users the ability to play four 1v1 games\\n\\n1) Mashing game - Who can rack up the highest number of button presses before time runs out?\\n2) Memory game - A pattern sequence, up to 3 levels of increasing difficulty. Test your memory!\\n3) Counting game - Keep track of your color light and how many times it flashes. Don\'t blink.\\n4) Reaction game - Who can react faster? Click the color that shows up as quick as you can.\\n\\nThe lights at the end of a game blink red if P1 has won and green if P2 (yellow if tie).\\n\\n## How we built it\\n\\nWe used two Python libraries. The FreeWheel API to communicate with the FREE-WILi and flash our code, and the pygame library to receive and read controller input. We also have a given header file for C++ definitions of useful functions that allow us to configure the FREE-WILi board, such as LED toggles and Display images.\\n\\n## Challenges we ran into\\n\\nThe FREE-WILi had some hardware limitations that prevented us from fully fledging out our implementation as was planned. Primarily, its I/O capabilities are limited, and cannot read controller input through USB-C as a general purpose computer can, so we had to keep the system wired to the computer during play. We also ran into space issues in uploading images to the display, so the UI is not as in depth as we would have liked.\\n\\n## Accomplishments that we\'re proud of\\n\\nFor having found out about this device only 24 hours before submission, we are very proud of the fact that we were able to flash the device with our software, turn on LEDs, upload images, and have it function properly with our controller input, despite the limitations we encountered.\\n\\n## What we learned\\n\\nWe learned a lot about how FREE-WILi works, how to write to it, and its functionalities. We also learned how to use pygame to process user inputs from a controller, to parse and control them correctly, and also how to manage multiple controllers.\\n\\n## What\'s next for Wili-Party\\n\\nIdeally, we would love to make the controller input work without running it through a computer for processing. We want the games to be able to be fully run on the FREE-WILi itself, with just two controllers as support. We would also like to make the communication wireless, so we are not cluttered with USB-C cables while playing.\\n\\n### Built With\\n\\n```c++``` ```freewili``` ```pygame``` ```python``` ```time```\\n\\n*Source* - [https://devpost.com/software/wili-party](https://devpost.com/software/wili-party)"},{"id":"wiLi-watch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wiLi-watch","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-10/wili-watch.md","title":"WiLi Watch \u2013 Voice-Activated Wearable for Smart Home Control","description":"Inspiration","date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"FREE-WILi","permalink":"/blog/tags/FREE-WILi","description":"Make Embedded Systems Fun Again !"},{"inline":false,"label":"Mhacks","permalink":"/blog/tags/mhacks","description":"mhacks"},{"inline":false,"label":"Hackathon","permalink":"/blog/tags/hackathon","description":"hackathon"},{"inline":false,"label":"Student Project","permalink":"/blog/tags/studentproject","description":"studentproject"}],"readingTime":3.58,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ethan McKean","url":"https://github.com/ethanmckean","imageURL":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp6HQQoZHtw_25wWy-SkVoz_cG9_jRL5EQWS_DZO=s96-c?height=180&width=180","key":"Ethan McKean","page":null},{"name":"Anshul Mohanty","imageURL":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK9K2cEyx4J_mFaKycysLoYvU1645F9do825AwoWqDBDQi6BA=s96-c?height=180&width=180","key":"Anshul Mohanty","page":null},{"name":"Alexandra Enders","title":"Computer Engineering Student at University of Michigan","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-enders-767bb21a5/","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQH0frMv24KVAg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1682174030294?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=dponlR2zkvlndYaTH8L2NwO9nBFaYsHlm3qlCnGT4Nk","key":"Alexandra Enders","page":null},{"name":"Austyn Nguyen","title":"Computer Science @ University of Michigan CoE","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austyn-an-nguyen","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHKClE_KoMA8g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1728396078758?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=kloWr79wkHIUm5fT8rTFhoISAaz64LGOsenxFeHtvqM","key":"Austyn Nguyen","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"wiLi-watch","title":"WiLi Watch \u2013 Voice-Activated Wearable for Smart Home Control","authors":["Ethan McKean","Anshul Mohanty","Alexandra Enders","Austyn Nguyen"],"date":"2024-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["FREE-WILi","mhacks","hackathon","student project"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"WiLi-Party LED Minigames","permalink":"/blog/wiLi-party"}},"content":"import YouTubeEmbed from \'@site/src/components/YouTubeEmbed\';\\n\\n<YouTubeEmbed videoId=\\"UYSAEgx3lSQ\\" />\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\nIn a world increasingly reliant on technology, the ability to interact with our surroundings effortlessly is essential, especially for individuals with mobility challenges. Enter the WiLi Watch, a wearable wristband powered by FREE-WILi and Groq aimed to empower users with independence.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe journey began with a vision: to create a device that could simplify and enhance daily living for individuals with movement impairments. Our team recognized the need for an intuitive interface that would allow users to control their smart home environment without the barriers typically posed by traditional devices. By harnessing the capabilities of the watch\'s built-in infrared (IR) transmitters, we sought to bridge the gap between technology and accessibility.\\n\\n## What it does\\n\\nThe user wears an embedded wristband device that can be used to control and interact with their environment. Here is the specific tasks that can be performed wirelessly from your wrist:\\n\\n- Turn on and off lights\\n- Lock and unlock your door\\n- Display live steamed camera footage of your doorstep\\n- Bring up your GCal or the weather to be displayed These tasks can either be initiated through buttons on the wristband, or from asking out loud for certain actions to be done. We use AI to predict your needs as well based on what you say. For example, if you mention \\"Oh did I forget to lock the door?\\" the door will lock automatically, and saying \\"will I need an umbrella later?\\" will cause the weather report to go on display. Additionally, a speaker announces to you every action that is done for peace of mind. Finally, one can inquire about who is at their door and the hub will describe to you your visitor.\\n\\n## How we built it\\n\\nThis project relies on the wireless IR communication between a FREE-WILi device and a smart home \\"hub\\" consisting of an Orange Pi 5 and Arduino Nano that control other peripherals such as a camera, door \\"locking\\" system, IR receiver module, speaker, microphone, and external monitor. The frameworks we used for development are Groq for easy LLM use (Whisper for speech to text and Llama for natural language reasoning) and Cartesia for speech-text interfacing, all developed on a python virtual environment. The project is also modular to be used with Intel\'s IDC if private LLM generation is desired (we setup a flask server serving llama.cpp inferencing on a compute instance but ran out of credits)\\n\\n## Challenges we ran into\\n\\n- Using GPIO on the Orange Pi; we had to pivot after hours to integrate another microcontroller with a functional GPIO interface for motor control and IF receiving\\n- Networking compatibility; we found out later than we\'d like that the Free WiLi device which we centered our project around does not have capabilities to connect to the internet / Bluetooth so we switched to IF communication\\n- Python development on Linux; Python virtual environments are not for the weak of heart\\n\\n## Accomplishments that we\'re proud of\\n\\n- Fully functional prototype built from the ground up in 24 hours!!\\n- Door locking system on a physical prototype + doorstep camera\\n- Overcoming Free WiLi debugging hurdles in the middle of the night\\n- Kept persistence even through sleep deprivation\\n\\n## What we learned\\n\\n- Hardware hacking is challenging, but super fun!\\n- Cable management can and will stress you out\\n- Implementing APIs in a larger program\\n- Wireless communication (IR and RF)\\n- Ideation is so important\\n\\n## What\'s next for The WiLi Watch\\n\\nIncrease in functionalities available on the watch as well as real world implementation (metal instead of cardboard). A few functionalities that we came up with that could be expanded on in further development are as follows:\\n\\n- Autonomous robotic car assistant that can retrieve items\\n- Interact with kitchen appliances (turn on/off stove)\\n- Emergency response / alarm system\\n- Temperature control\\n\\n## Built With\\n\\n`arduino-nano` `cartesia` `freewili` `groq` `llama` `orange-pi` `python` `whisper`\\n\\n### Try it out\\n\\n\x3c!-- ![GitHub](./github.png) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ethanmckean/The-WiLi-Watch-mhacks24) --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- ![GitHub](./github.png) <a target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" href=\\"https://github.com/ethanmckean/The-WiLi-Watch-mhacks24\\" class=\\"inline-image\\">GitHub Repo</a> --\x3e\\n\\n<div class=\\"github-img\\">\\n\\n![GitHub](./github.png) <a href=\\"https://github.com/ethanmckean/The-WiLi-Watch-mhacks24\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span>GitHub Repo</span></a>\\n</div>\\n\\n*Source* - [https://devpost.com/software/wili-watch](https://devpost.com/software/wili-watch)"}]}}')}}]);
