## 🌟 Inspiration
We were inspired by the nostalgic charm of Nintendo DS StreetPass, where chance encounters led to exciting virtual interactions. We wanted to bring that sense of discovery and connection to the hacker community, fostering real-world interactions in a digital age.

<hr/>

## 🎵 What it does
Wili-Pass allows hackers to exchange digital 'passports' when their FREE-WILi devices come within range. These passports contain user-defined profiles, including stats, personalized images, and audio messages. It's a way to instantly learn about and connect with fellow hackers at events and gatherings.

<hr/> 

## 🛠️ How we built it
We used the FREE-WILi dev board's antenna capabilities to detect near by hackers. Once detected, the unique hacker signature is used to query their profile. The passing hacker profile is then displayed for each hacker to view and connect with one another.

<hr/>

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
Communicating with the FREE-WILi over antenna proved to be very challenging. Getting the environment and tool chain setup, was also harder than expected.

<hr/>

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
Communicating between boards.

<hr/>

## 📚 What we learned
Planning and re-evaluating feasibility of ideas.

<hr/>

## 🚀 What's next for Wili pass
Wide spread hackathon use!
