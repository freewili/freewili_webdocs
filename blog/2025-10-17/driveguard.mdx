## Inspiration

Distracted driving causes so many preventable accidents every year. I wanted to create something that reacts in real time to help drivers stay focused. That idea became **DriveGuard**, powered by FREE-WILi, a system that monitors where the driver is looking and uses LED feedback to keep them alert.

## What it does

- **DriveGuard** uses computer vision to track the driver’s eyes and head position.
- If the driver is distracted, the **FREE-WILi LEDs turn red** to warn them.
- If the driver is focused, the LEDs stay **green**.
- Everything happens live, giving the driver constant awareness of their focus on the road.

## How we built it

The system was built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe** for tracking, along with **FREE-WILi scripts** to control the LED indicators. A simulated driving video runs beside the webcam feed to mimic a real driving environment and test the system’s accuracy.

## Challenges we ran into

It was challenging to work with a system I had no prior experience in. The **FREE-WILi scripts** were difficult to find and understand at first, so I had to do a lot of research and testing to get everything working properly. Integrating new hardware with computer vision took time and patience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Fully functional system
- Successful integration with **FREE-WILi**
- LED light feedback that clearly shows driver status
- Real-time system that runs smoothly

## What we learned

I learned how hard it can be to bring multiple systems together, but also how rewarding it feels when it works. I also discovered how powerful **computer vision** is — especially **MediaPipe**. It was amazing to see it detect distraction even when my head was straight but my eyes were wandering.

## What's next for DriveGuard
Next, I want to integrate the **FREE-WILi bracelets** for more feedback and possibly add a **beep sound** when distraction is detected. I also plan to **optimize the system** to reduce delay and make it react even faster.

## Built With

`mediapipe`
`opencv`
`python`
