> Motion & voice control for computers. We map wrist movements to keystrokes and use voice for web scrolling, giving users hands-free input control.

## 4kHD_Accessibility: Alternative Input Control System

## üí° Inspiration

The primary goal of **4kHD_Accessibility** is to address the significant barrier that traditional keyboards and mice present to individuals with various disabilities, particularly those with limited upper body mobility or dexterity. We were inspired to create an **intuitive and feature-rich** alternative input method that offers comprehensive control over computing interfaces using accessible physical movements and voice commands.

## üíª What it does

Our project provides a versatile alternative input control system based on physical motion and voice commands.

**1. Motion-to-Keystroke Mapping (Wrist Control):**

- Utilizes motion-tracking to capture simple, distinct wrist movements.
- Maps these movements directly to standard keyboard **keystrokes** (e.g., WASD, arrow keys, Space).
- This allows for functional control over games and applications, as demonstrated in our included demos.

**2. Voice-Activated Web Navigation:**

- Enables hands-free web interaction.
- Users can issue voice commands to **scroll up and scroll down** on any web page.

üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

We built **4kHD_Accessibility** by combining specialized hardware integration with robust software models.

- **Motion Control (Wrist):**
  - We utilized the **FREE-WILi's** platform to capture motion data.
  - We developed custom Python scripts ( see `scripts/one_wili_wasd.py`, `combo_wili.py` ) to process the sensor data and translate distinct wrist movements into clean keystroke outputs.

- **Voice Integration:**
  - We incorporated **Google's Speech-to-Text model** via the **Python SpeechRecognition library**.
  - This converts spoken commands into text, which our scripts ( e.g., `scripts/aud.py` , `scripts/aud_with_search.py` ) then map to web scroll actions.

- **Demonstrations:**
  - The project includes several demo games (**Demo/**) to immediately showcase the real-world usability of the motion control input.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

| Folder   | Contents                                                                                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Demo/    | `Chess.html`, `chess.py`, `connect4.html`, `connect4.py`, `tron.py`                                                                                 | Contains files for simple web-based and application-based games to demonstrate motion-to-keystroke control in a real-world setting. |
| scripts/ | `aud.py`, `aud_with_search.py`, `audiocapture.py`, `both_wili.py`, `combo_wili.py`, `combo_with_audio.py`, `live_cam.py`, `one_wili_wasd.py`        | The core Python scripts that handle motion data capture, voice recognition, keystroke mapping, and camera/system interaction.       |

## üõë Challenges we ran into

- **Defining Actionable Control**: Creating the different motions for actionable control was challenging. We had to find a balance between motions that are simple enough for users to perform consistently, yet distinct enough to be reliably recognized by the system without false positives.
- **FreeWilis Limitations**: The **FreeWilis Camera doesn't have native live feed support**. This required us to develop technical workarounds to process the motion data effectively in near real-time, which was critical for maintaining responsiveness.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we successfully delivered a robust proof-of-concept:

- **Functional Motion Controller**: We successfully built a controller that can identify different motions and map those motions to keystrokes for **real-world examples**, as demonstrated by the working games in the `Demo/` folder.
- **Focused Voice Control**: We were able to implement precise voice control to handle **page scrolling**, which is a key interaction for hands-free web browsing.

## üß† What we learned

This project provided deep insights into accessibility development:

- We gained a thorough understanding of the **FreeWili** platform and its technical documentation.
- We learned how to integrate and optimize **Google's Speech-to-Text model** for application control.
- We mastered the essentials of developing robust algorithms for accessible **motion control**.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's next for 4kHD_Accessibility

This is just the beginning. Our vision for the project's future includes:

- **Real-World Deployment**: Potential for better implementation for **real-world deployment**. This includes creating a stable, installable application and conducting extensive user testing with the target community.
- **Expanded Voice Commands**: Expanding the voice command set beyond scrolling to allow interaction with links, buttons, and form inputs.
- **Advanced Gesture Library**: Developing a wider range of recognized motion and gesture commands for more complex, fine-grained control.
