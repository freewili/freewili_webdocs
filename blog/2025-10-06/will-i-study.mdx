## 🌟 Inspiration
We were inspired by noticing what had worked well in our own study sessions, which was always a form of tracking, and taking it to the next level with this project.

--- 

## 🛠️ What it does
It tracks your study sessions using computer vision to make sure you stay on task and record analytics of how focused you are throughout your session. It gives recommendations based on how your study sessions went.

---

## 💻 How we built it
We have the front-end built in React letting us put together a very visually appealing dynamic website, we wrote the back-end in Go for flexibility and performance, and we interfaced with the hardware using Python for its versatility. Using different tooling was a good opportunity for each of us to bring our own expertise to the table and to learn from each other.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges we ran into
Working with hardware is always very finicky, however we managed to reliably get the camera and microphone working as data points that our code could use.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our session management system so we can compactly store previous session data in order to compare your recent study sessions against previous ones, allowing for further insight.

---

## 📚 What we learned
We learnt a lot about how to integrate embedded systems into a web dashboard in a unified way with the back-end.

---

## 🚀 What's next for Will I Study?
The next steps would be to take more advantage of the hardware, as the more useful data points we get the better predictions and recommendations we can give. There are plenty of options, but integrating with screen capture or eye tracking would be a good choice.
