Motion-to-Keystroke Mapping (Wrist Control):  Utilizes motion-tracking to capture simple, distinct wrist movements.Maps these movements directly to standard keyboard keystrokes (e.g., WASD, arrow keys, Space).This allows for functional control over games and applications, as demonstrated in our included demos.  2. Voice-Activated Web Navigation:  Enables hands-free web interaction.Users can issue voice commands to scroll up and scroll down on any web page.  🛠️ How we built it  We built 4kHD_Accessibility by combining specialized hardware integration with robust software models.  Motion Control (Wrist): We utilized the FREE-WILi's platform to capture motion data.We developed custom Python scripts ( see scripts/one_wili_wasd.py, combo_wili.py ) to process the sensor data and translate distinct wrist movements into clean keystroke outputs. Voice Integration: We incorporated Google's Speech-to-Text model via the Python SpeechRecognition library.This converts spoken commands into text, which our scripts ( e.g., scripts/aud.py , scripts/aud_with_search.py ) then map to web scroll actions. Demonstrations: The project includes several demo games (Demo/) to immediately showcase the real-world usability of the motion control input.

The app allows users to enter their zip code, provide a budget, and input their shopping list, which could include separate ingredients or potential recipes. The app looks for nearby stores and pulls item lists from each. Behind the scenes, AI is used to optimize and improve the shopping list, suggesting additional items the user may want and allowing misspellings. Options from different price ranges are given so that the user can choose between the generic brand, name brand, and organic options. Then, mapping information for a path through the store is sent to the FREE-WILi Compasses. Customers' pagers (attached to their shopping carts) display the map to navigate through the stores and buttons can be pressed to indicate an item has been found. In addition, customer pagers can emit an IR signal to request help from an employee, turning on the LEDs. Each customer pager has its own color ID associated. When employee pagers receive that IR request, the customer is added to the help queue and the LEDs on the FREE-WILi pager display the queue by color ID. Once a customer is helped, employees can mark the customer as &quot;helped&quot;, which removes their color ID from the LED queue, and the customer LED lights turn off through a received IR signal.

Neoverse/Cortex targeting: The service takes -mcpu (e.g., neoverse-v2, neoverse-n2, cortex-x4) so we can see how the same kernel schedules across Arm cores. This helped us reason about expected gains and bottlenecks before touching real hardware.  Armv9-A &amp; SVE2 path: Alongside the baseline and SME2 stub, we added an autovectorized SVE2 variant (using -march=armv9-a+sve2 and optional -msve-vector-bits=) to compare baseline vs SVE2 vs SME2 side-by-side.  Streaming mode + ZA plumbing: We explicitly enter/exit SME streaming mode and toggle ZA (smstart sm/za … smstop za/sm) to validate state handling and ensure our future SME2 micro-kernels will model correctly.  Developer workflow on macOS/Linux: We used Homebrew LLVM (clang/llvm-mca 21.x) with -target aarch64-linux-gnu for cross-assembly generation, making it easy to test Arm scheduling locally without an Arm board.  Tooling as an agent tool: The analyzer is exposed as /tools/arm_sme2/analyze and our uAgents agent can call it in chains (e.g., “run SME2 analyzer mcpu=neoverse-v2 n=256”), turning Arm perf exploration into a composable tool inside the broader agent system.

The project is divided into three parts, the OpenCV model, backend environment and the user interface on the FREE-WILi.  We used a proprietary graphics innovation, built to scale from the ground up. Because of the lack of GUI for the python api of freeWili, and us only being able to push images to the screen, we utilized the pillow library to dynamically stitch images together to create a game ready gui, capable of running at just seconds per frame. With this robust solution, we can scale easy as the first ai powered lightbulb assistant.  The OpenCV model stores two image files (old_photo and new_photo). Every 15 seconds, old_photo is discarded, new_photo becomes old_photo, and a new photo is taken. The computer vision model calculates the difference in brightness between the old_photo and new_photo to detect if lights were switched on/off.  The backend environment mainly exists within the Pet class, where variables such as health, points, the amount of time the lights were on, etc. are tracked. Additionally, functions that control the conditions for losses and gains of a pet's health depending on the usage of lights are implemented. These functions and variables are utilized to connect with the user interface of the FREE-WILi device.

We started with people—our grandparents, a neighbor who lives alone, an aunt who’s nervous at the doctor because English isn’t her first language. We kept hearing the same quiet problems: “I don’t want to bother anyone,” “I didn’t understand what they said,” “I panicked and forgot what to do.” That’s where Willi began—not as tech, but as a promise to make tough moments feel smaller and less lonely.  At first we sketched way too much: apps, dashboards, ten different modes. Then we watched our test users fumble with menus and tiny icons and we realized: in a tough moment you only want one thing press, and something helpful happens. That’s how we landed on five simple buttons. No hunting, no swiping, just muscle memory.  We built the first prototype on a FreeWili/ESP-style board with big, tactile buttons. Red became SOS. Blue was “talk to me” a friendly companion that listens and turns worries into clear next steps. Yellow handled translation so anyone could speak and the user would hear it in their own language. White sent discreet beeps to nearby devices when saying “help” out loud wasn’t safe. Green let you snap a photo and hear what it is, surprisingly powerful for low-vision moments like “Is this the right medicine?”  The wiring was the easy part. The hard parts were human: Simplicity vs. power. We kept asking, “Would my grandma understand this at 2 a.m.?” If the answer was “maybe,” we cut it.  Trustworthy guidance. Health advice had to sound calm and plain, not robotic. We iterated a lot on tone and step-by-step phrasing.  Language is personal. Translation isn’t just words; it’s respect. We tuned it to feel natural and kind.  Offline first. We didn’t want the device to panic just because the Wi-Fi did. Local alerts and simple fallbacks became non-negotiables.  We learned that “friendliness” isn’t a feature you toggle it’s the sum of a thousand tiny choices: the button feel, the way the voice greets you, how instructions pause and wait for you to breathe. We learned that one clear step beats ten clever ones. And we learned that people open up when they feel seen and unhurried.  Is Willi finished? Not even close. Next, we want pilots in senior centers and clinics, more languages that sound like home, and a gentle caregiver view that reassures families without drowning them in notifications. But the heart of it is set: Willi is the friend who stays, listens, speaks your language, and gets help moving so being alone doesn’t have to feel lonely.

Because of the SRAM configuration, the FPGA can be reprogrammed unlimted times at anytime by the RP2040 chip. To do this the RP2040 uses the the FPGA DONE, FPGA RESET and SPI interface from the RP2040. The ice40 documentation calls this the &quot;SPI Slave Configuration Interface&quot;. This method of programming is described in the Lattice ICE40 document &quot;iCE40 Programming and Configuration&quot; with document number FPGA-TN-02001. When reprogramming the FPGA the bit file would be fed from the RP2040. An obvious place to store the bit file is RP2040 flash as a const byte array. The Intrepid IO app can store multiple FPGA bit files in its file system and load them on command or at startup. It can also load them directly from USB.","keywords":"iCE40 FPGA Programming FPGA SRAM Configuration RP2040 FPGA Reprogramming SPI Slave Configuration Interface Intrepid IO App FPGA Management FPGA Bit Files Storage","version":"Next"},{"title":"FPGA Default Application","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/hardware-low-level-details/ice40-fpga/fpga-default-application/","content":"FPGA Default Application The default FPGA application is a simple design that transforms the FREE-WILi into a sigrok-compatible logic analyzer. The design features an IO buffer that can set the directions of the SPI and UART pins as well as GPIO_26 and GPIO27. To enable this programming, the IO_CONFIG_ENABLE pin must be asserted - this allows the FPGA's SPI-Slave to assume control of the SPI interface with the main RP2040 as the master. The pin direction defaults are as specified in GPIO. Please note that the pin directionality is also dependent on the sn74lxc1t45 hardware IO buffers between the FPGA and breakout pins. For the logic analyzer, the FPGA samples the SPI pins at the clock frequency provided by the main RP2040 - this design expects a frequency of 31.25 MHz. The samples are encoded via Run-Length Encoding and, once the FPGA is initiated by sigrok via FTDI, stored in a 32 kB FIFO built using the iCE40's on-chip SPRAM. Finally, these samples are sent via the FT1248 4-wire communication protocol to USB where sigrok can collect them. The libsigrok fork where the FREE-WILi hardware driver was developed can be found at libsigrok-fwili.

The Bottlenose firmware is built into the FREE-WILi firmware and can be flashed directly from FREE-WILi.  Locate Control Buttons: On the Bottlenose PCB, you'll find two buttons: &quot;BOOT&quot; button - Used to enter bootloader mode&quot;RESET&quot; button - Used to reset the ESP32-C6  Button Location The BOOT and RESET buttons are typically located near the ESP32-C6 chip on the Bottlenose PCB. Look for small tactile buttons labeled &quot;BOOT&quot; and &quot;RST&quot; or &quot;RESET&quot;.  Use Small Tools for Button Pressing The BOOT and RESET buttons are very small and can be difficult to press accurately with fingers. For easier and more precise button pressing, use: Tweezers (plastic or metal)Small screwdriver (non-conductive preferred)Pen tip or pencil eraserToothpick or similar small pointed tool This ensures you press the correct button without accidentally pressing adjacent components.  Enter Bootloader Mode: The ESP32-C6 must be in bootloader mode to receive firmware from FREE-WILi: Step-by-step process: Hold down the &quot;BOOT&quot; button and keep it pressedWhile holding BOOT, press and release the &quot;RESET&quot; button (quick tap)Release the &quot;BOOT&quot; button ✅ The ESP32-C6 is now in bootloader mode and ready to receive firmware  Important Timing Make sure to hold the BOOT button BEFORE pressing RESET, and only release BOOT after you've released RESET.

The event data goes into a queue and these are read at will by an App. The API supports logging text data through a global Log.
