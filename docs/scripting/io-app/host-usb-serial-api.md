# Host USB Serial API

To control FREE-WILi with a host device such as a Linux/Windows PC or Raspberry Pi you can use the USB serial API.

By opening a USB serial port code and send menu commands and interpret the responses.  

The menu text useful for command line interface can be disabled by sending ASCII `CTRL + B`. It can be re enabled using `CTRL + C`.
