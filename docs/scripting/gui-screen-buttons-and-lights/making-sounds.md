# Making sounds

FREE-WILi includes a speaker. The speaker allows you to play sounds stored as wav files in the file system.

The sounds directory can include wav files that can be played from the serial menu. The menu option `'g'` will let you enter in a wav file to play. They will also be listed in the sound board app.

The wav files supported currently are 8khz stereo or mono files encoded as 16 bit PCM. The speaker is one channel so the second channel in stereo is discarded. Mono files are recommended because they are smaller.

The sounds are stored in the sounds directory. By default the sounds will be searched by name here. Since they are all wav extensions you do not need to include the extension. If you have a sound somewhere else in the file system, specify the entire path. For example a recorded sound, `\record\rec1.wav`

Sounds can be launched from the serial API or host RP2040 API. Also the sound board app can launch sounds.

There is an API call (playSoundFromNumber) that can read numbers out loud via a 1980s text-to-speech technique. This is playing sequences of wav files to say a number.
