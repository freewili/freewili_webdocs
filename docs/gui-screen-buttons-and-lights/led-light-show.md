# LED Light Show

FREE-WILi has 7 full color LEDs. These LEDs can display a pattern or be manually controlled by the API or App. Some of the patterns incorporate sensor data or make the LEDs a bargraph. The LED pattern can also be sent out GPIO pins to support LED Light strips. The light show can be controlled by a Roku IR remote.

## API

There are APIs to control the board LEDS below. When setBoardLED is called it will disable the light show. 

You can set the LED to a static color or make it flash or fade. The setBoardLED allows you to use the LEDs this way.

```c

// Control Manual
enum fwLEDManagerLEDMode {
	ledsimplevalue,
	ledflash,
	ledpulse,
	ledflashfade,
	ledpulsefade,
};
void setBoardLED(int iLEDIndex0_7, 
        int iR, int iG, int iB, int iDurationMs, fwLEDManagerLEDMode iMode);

// Set a Light show        
void setLEDShowMode(int iLEDShow);

```
