# Li-ION Battery and Power Management

FREE-WILi contains a Lithium ION Battery to support portable applications. This battery has the below specifications. Care should be taken leaving FREE-WILi in places where it could overheat (such as direct sunlight).

The main screen will indicate the battery status. By default the battery will be charged when plugged into USB.

How long the battery will last will depend on the current of the FREE-WILi. Substantial current savings can be found by using the screen timeout and limiting the use of the LEDs. Currently, the battery will last between 4 and 8 hours. In the future we expect this to improve with better sleep firmware.

## Settings

There are settings that control the power usage of FREE-WILi. This includes display brightness, display timeout, wake up sound, and wake up on move. Normally only the button presses wake the screen.

The wake up on sound will wake the display on a sound threshold while the move wakes if the device moves.
