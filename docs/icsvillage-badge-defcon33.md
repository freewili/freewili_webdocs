## Introduction and Overview

Thank you for purchasing a FREE-WILi [ICS Village](https://icsvillage.com/) Badge tool sponsored by FREE-WiLi and [Intrepid Control Systems](https://intrepidcs.com/). Thanks to our sponsors for allowing us to keep the prices low for everyone to get access to this badge at an affordable price.

The ICS Village Badge for DEF CON 33 is a hands-on tool designed to explore Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security. It expands on last year's FREE-WILi [Whale Tail badge](https://freewili.com/products/whale-tail/) by focusing on physical and environmental exploitation. With a rich set of built-in hardware, sensors, and software features, the badge allows you to interact with real-world ICS challenges.

The hardware is housed in a stunning, full-color PCB designed by Detroit artist [Kyle Irving](https://www.kyleriseirving.com/). At its core, the badge is powered by a **Raspberry Pi RP2350A microcontroller**.
