# WILEYE Flashing WILEye Orca Firmware onto ESP32-P4-EYE

Before we can have the FREE-WILi control the WILEye, we will need to custome firmware onto the ESP32-P4-EYE device. This guide will walk you through how to flash the custom firmware over the ESP32-P4-EYE's USB JTAG port.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- WILEYE Camera Orca properly connected to FREE-WILi (see [Hardware Hookup](/extending-with-orcas/wileye-camera-orca/wileye-hardware-hookup/))
- USB-C cable for programming and power
- Computer with Python installed
- **Python** 3.5 or greaterhttps://www.python.org/downloads/
- **WILEYE firmware files downloaded** from the FREE-WILi Github WILEye repository: **https://github.com/freewili/WILEye-Firmware**
- **Latest ESPTool** from the Espressif's Github **https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases/tag/v5.1.0**



## Step 1: Install ESPTool and Flash Custom WILEye Firmware onto ESP32-P4-EYE

Before you can use WILEYE with FREE-WILi, you need to flash the proper firmware to the ESP32-P4-EYE module.

### Install ESPTool

First, install the ESPTool utility which is required for flashing ESP32 devices:

#### Windows/Mac/Linux - Install ESPTOOL using Pip
```bash
# Install esptool using pip (recommended)
pip install esptool
```

#### Downloading the ESPTool executable

**Windows - Using executable:**
1. Download `esptool.exe` from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases)
2. Place it in a folder in your PATH

**Linux - Using package manager:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install esptool

# Fedora
sudo dnf install esptool
```
**Alternatily you can use the ESPTool python module**
```
python -m pip install esptool
```

### Download WILEYE Firmware

**Download the latest WILEye's firmware binary files from the FREE-WILi's Github:**

ðŸ”— **https://github.com/freewili/WILEye-Firmware**

:::tip FREE-WILEye Firmware
This repository contains the pre-compiled binary files needed to update your ESP32-P4-EYE firmware. Download the `.bin` files for flashing to your WILEYE module.
:::

1. **Navigate to the GitHub repository** and download the latest release or binary files
2. **Look for the pre-compiled binary files** (`.bin` files) needed for ESP32-P4-EYE:
   - `bootloader.bin` - ESP32-P4 bootloader
   - `wileye_app_demo.bin` - Espressif's ESP32-P4-EYE factory-demo firmware with FREE-WILi support over Serial.
   - `partition-table.bin` - Memory partition configuration

3. **Create a firmware folder** on your computer and place all binary files inside:
   ```
   wileye-firmware/
   â”œâ”€â”€ bootloader.bin
   â”œâ”€â”€ wileye_app_demo.bin
   â””â”€â”€ partition-table.bin
   ```

For advanced users who want to modify or build custom firmware, refer to the ESP32-P4-EYE hardware documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32p4/esp32-p4-eye/index.html
:::

### Connect WILEYE for Programming

1. **Connect USB-C cable** from your computer to the ESP32-P4-EYE USB port labled as "Debug". Make sure the ESP32-P4-EYE's power switch is set to the "I" position

![wileye-usbc-to-debug-port](../../assets/wileye-usbc-to-debug-port.png "wileye-usbc-to-debug-port")

2. **Note your COM port** - you'll need this for the flashing command (e.g., COM12, /dev/ttyUSB0)

### Flash the Firmware

Navigate to your firmware folder in the command prompt/terminal and run the flashing command:

#### Windows Example:
```bash
cd C:\path\to\wileye-firmware
esptool.exe -p COM12 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32p4 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x2000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 wileye_app_demo.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin
```

#### Mac/Linux Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/wileye-firmware
esptool -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32p4 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x2000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 factory_demo.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin
```

#### ESPTool Python Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/wileye-firmware
python esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32p4 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x2000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 factory_demo.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin
```


### Expected Output

You should see output similar to this:

### Troubleshooting Firmware Flash

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "Failed to connect to ESP32"
# Solution 1: Try different baud rate
```bash
python esptool.py -p COM12 -b 115200 --chip esp32p4 chip_id
```
# Solution 2: Verify that the Power switch on the ESP32-P4-EYE board is turned on

**Problem**: "File not found" errors
```bash
# Make sure you're in the correct directory
pwd  # Check current directory
ls   # List files (Linux/Mac)
dir  # List files (Windows)

# Files should be in current directory:
# bootloader.bin, factory_demo.bin, partition-table.bin
```

## Step 2: Enable UART Orca Communication On FREE-WILi

Now that the ESP32-P4-EYE is running modified demo code with FREE-WILEye support, we can now move on to setting up the FREE-WILi to communicate to the FREE-WILEye.

:::tip UART Parameters Auto-Configuration
When you enable WILEYE Communication in Orca Setup, FREE-WILi automatically configures the required UART parameters:
- **Baud Rate**: 5 Mbps
- **Flow Control**: CTS and RTS enabled (Hardware flow control)
- **Data Bits**: 8
- **Stop Bits**: 1
- **Parity**: None

Hardware flow control ensures reliable high-speed data transmission between FREE-WILi and WILEYE, preventing data loss during image transfers.
:::

You can enable FREE-WILEye Uart Comms either through FREE-WILi Main's USB console or through the FREE-WILi's UI panel. We will be covering both methods below.


### Enabling WILEye Orca comm via USB Console

1. **Open up the COM port** related to FREE-WILi's Main cpu either by Putty, your favtior serial port monitor, or through FREE-WILi GUI.

### Interfacing with WILEye via FREE-WILI's Python API 

WILEye's API is also exposed via FREE-WILi's Python API. The API footprint is the same as the WILEye API listed in the USB console.

You can find an example on how to use the API here: https://github.com/freewili/freewili-python/blob/master/examples/wileye_simple.py 

## Troubleshooting Hardware Issues
 **WILEye API commands are returning Failed**: Verify that the WILEye Camera is in the correct orientation when it is connected to the adpater board and that the Orca Communication over UART is set to `WILEye`. If issue still presists, verify that the UART settings are below for WILEye comm. If the parameters are mismatch, try setting them manually:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Baud Rate** | 5,000,000 bps (5 Mbps) | 
| **Data Bits** | 8 |
| **Stop Bits** | 1 |
| **Parity** | None |
| **Flow Control** | RTS/CTS |

However, if the UART parameters are correct, try rebooting the FREE-WILi and the FREE-WILEYE devices.


## Next Steps

Now that your WILEYE Camera Orca is set up and working:
