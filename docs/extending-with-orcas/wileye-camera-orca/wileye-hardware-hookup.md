# WILEYE Hardware Hookup Guide

This guide covers the physical setup and connections for the WILEYE Camera Orca module.

## About the ESP32-P4-EYE Platform

The WILEYE Camera Orca is built around the ESP32-P4-EYE development board from Espressif. For comprehensive technical documentation about the hardware platform, refer to:

üìñ **ESP32-P4-EYE Official Documentation**: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32p4/esp32-p4-eye/index.html

This official documentation provides detailed information about:
- Complete hardware schematics and component layout
- Camera sensor specifications and configuration
- GPIO pin assignments and electrical characteristics
- Power consumption and thermal considerations
- Advanced programming examples and ESP-IDF integration

:::tip Hardware Reference
For advanced users working directly with the ESP32-P4-EYE, the official Espressif documentation is the authoritative source for all hardware specifications and programming details.
:::

## Required Components
- 1 x ESP32-P4-EYE
- 1 x FREE-WIL-EYE Orca module Adapter
- 1 x USB-C cable for programming/power (optional, for interfacing with FREE-WILi or getting images from ESP32 P4 EYE)
- 1 x MicroSD card (optional, for data logging)

## Physical Connections

### Connecting to FREE-WILi

1. **Power down** your FREE-WILi device before making connections
2. **Align the Orca connector** on the WILEYE module with the Orca port on your FREE-WILi device
3. **Gently press** the modules together until the connectors are fully seated
4. **Verify alignment** by checking that the boards are parallel and the connector is fully engaged

:::warning Proper Orientation Required!
**CRITICAL:** The camera lens must be visible on the same side as the FREE-WILi logo on the adapter board. Before connecting the FREE-WIL-EYE Orca adapter to FREE-WILi, verify this alignment to prevent damage. Incorrect orientation may cause a short circuit that could damage both your FREE-WILi and the ESP32-P4-EYE!

## MicroSD Card Installation

An MicroSD card can be connected to the ESP-P4-EYE to save videos and pictures. 

:::tip SD Card Recommendations
- Use Class 10 or higher MicroSD cards for optimal performance
- Format the card as FAT32 for best compatibility
- 32GB or smaller cards are recommended for fastest boot times

## GPIO and Expansion

### Communication between ESP32-P4-EYE and FREE-WILi
The FREE-WIL-EYE Orca module Adapter routes UART data and hardware handshake lines between ESP32-P4-EYE and FREE-WILi.

#### UART Pinout

| ESP32-P4-EYE Pin | FREE-WILi Pin     | Function                               |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ESP_5V           | 5V OUT           | Power Supply (5V)                      |
| GPIO37           | UART1_TX_Out     | Transmit Data (FREE-WILi ‚Üí ESP32 )      |
| GPIO38           | UART1_RX_IN      | Receive Data (ESP32 ‚Üí FREE-WILi)       |
| GPIO34           | UART1_CTS_IN     | Clear to Send (Hardware Flow Control)  |
| GPIO51           | UART1_RTS_OUT    | Request to Send (Hardware Flow Control)|
| GND              | GND              | Ground Reference                       |

Both device's UART is configured with the following parameters:
- **5 Mbps Baudrate** - High-speed communication for image/video data
- **CTS and RTS Controls Enabled** - Hardware flow control for reliable transmission
- **8 Data Bits** - Standard data frame size
- **1 Stop Bit** - Standard frame termination
- **No Parity** - Error detection handled at higher protocol levels


:::tip UART parameters on FREE-WILi
FREE-WILi will automatically set the required UART parameters if you enable WILEye Communicaiotn in the Orac Setup Setting. We will be going over that later.

### Additional Exposed Pins

The FREE-WIL-EYE Orca adapter also exposes additional FREE-WILi's IO to allow interfacing with additional interfaces:
- I2C communication (SDA/SCL) over the QWIIC connector
- SPI interface
- Digital I/O pins
- Power rails (3.3V, 5V, GND)



### Pin Configuration
For detailed pin assignments and GPIO capabilities, refer to the ESP32-P4-EYE official documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32p4/esp32-p4-eye/index.html

## Troubleshooting Hardware Issues

### Camera Problems
- **No image**: Check camera cable connection and lens cap
- **Blurry images**: Adjust manual focus ring
- **Poor image quality**: Clean lens surface and check lighting conditions

## Next Steps
