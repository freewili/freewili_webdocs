   ls /dev/tty.usb*
   
   # Should show: /dev/tty.usbserial-xxxxx
   ```

   **Linux:**
   ```bash
   # Check available ports
   ls /dev/ttyUSB*
   
   # Should show: /dev/ttyUSB0 (or similar)
   ```

4. **Note your COM port** - you'll need this for the flashing command (e.g., COM12, /dev/ttyUSB0)

### Flash the Firmware

Navigate to your firmware folder in the command prompt/terminal and run the flashing command:

#### Windows Example:
```cmd
cd C:\path\to\wileye-firmware
python esptool.py -p COM12 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32p4 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x2000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 factory_demo.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin
```

#### Mac/Linux Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/wileye-firmware
python esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32p4 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x2000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 factory_demo.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin
```

### Troubleshooting Firmware Flash

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "Failed to connect to ESP32"
```bash
# Solution 1: Try different baud rate
python esptool.py -p COM12 -b 115200 --chip esp32p4 chip_id

# Solution 2: Hold BOOT button while connecting USB
# Then release after connection is established

# Solution 3: Try different USB cable or port
```

**Problem**: "Invalid head of packet (0x50)"
```bash
# Solution: Reset the device and try again
python esptool.py -p COM12 --chip esp32p4 --before default_reset chip_id
```

**Problem**: "File not found" errors
```bash
# Make sure you're in the correct directory
pwd  # Check current directory
ls   # List files (Linux/Mac)
dir  # List files (Windows)

# Files should be in current directory:
# bootloader.bin, factory_demo.bin, partition-table.bin
```

**Problem**: Flash verification failed
```bash
# Try slower baud rate
python esptool.py -p COM12 -b 115200 ... (rest of command)

# Or erase flash first
python esptool.py -p COM12 --chip esp32p4 erase_flash
# Then try flashing again
```

### Verify Firmware Installation

After successful flashing:

1. **Disconnect and reconnect** the USB cable
2. **Check serial output** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Monitor serial output to verify firmware is running
   python -m serial.tools.miniterm COM12 115200
   ```
